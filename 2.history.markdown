# Australia - New Zealand Pan History

While the steel pan itself is a relatively recent invention (some say it is the only acoustic musical instrument invented in the 20th century), its presence in Australia and New Zealand is even more recent. Writing a retrospective history is always difficult, since it depends on the collective memories of a large number of people. The following chronology is an attempt to record the history of the steel pan in Australia and New Zealand.

Any omissions or errors are the responsibility of the team of writers. Additions and corrections to the history are welcomed at info@panz.org.au.
