At the inaugural Australian Steelband Festival in Marysville, Victoria, a decision was taken to create a regional steelband association. In July 2013 PANZ (Pan Australia and New Zealand) was formed and PANZ Inc became an incorporated association, registered in Queensland in August 2013, with Lennox Jordan as the first president.
