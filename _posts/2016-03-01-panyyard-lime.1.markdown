<p><span><strong>A Review of PANZfest 2015</strong></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">by Mark Loquan, Musical Director, Perth Pandemix</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';"><br></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">What happens when you have a lot of pan enthusiasts from players, tuners, Carnival mas players, arrangers, and pan supporters in one place? &nbsp;You get lots of music, but more than that, you get another step in the development of pan, this time in Brisbane, Queensland, in Australia, where steelbands appeared from all over Australia and New Zealand for the 2nd Australian Steelpan Festival held at West End State School grounds. &nbsp;The festival represented a significant milestone for PANZ, an association of steelbands across Australia and New Zealand, formed in 2013, following the 1st Australian Steelpan Festival in Marysville, Victoria held in April 2013 (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7i_f8m1Mt_o" target="_blank">You Tube Link</a>). &nbsp;In fact, it was immediately after the first festival where the decision was made to form the association, PANZ, to act as a catalyst to develop pan in the region. &nbsp;A <a href="../files/panz-strategic-plan.pdf" target="_blank">Strategic Plan</a> was developed, with a central point being the planning of a biennial event where all bands could work towards. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">While the 1st Steelpan Festival was produced on a grander scale, enabled by significant grants and the involvement of the entire community of Marysville, the 2nd Festival faced challenges of funding, and competing events in Brisbane (Brisbane Festival). &nbsp;The event was scaled down from the original plans, but the spirit and love for the pan was just as strong or even stronger. This is because people had already established a connection with each other from the first Festival, and a good sign of development were new bands joining in the event. &nbsp;The new bands were:&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px;

An impromptu ramajay session broke out between Lennox Jordan, Australia’s lead pan maker/performer/arranger, and Manish Robinson, the Japan based pan maker/performer/arranger, exhibiting fantastic pan playing skills, which went immediately into an exciting session of Trini to De Bone, which had the crowd totally thrilled.</span></p><p><img src="../_Media/application-18_med.png" class="not-first-item" style="width:720px; height:314px;" height="314" width="720"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>Impromptu pan shootout between Manish and Lennox</em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: 'Comic Sans MS'; font-size: 14px;">Then the mass performance got underway, with all the bands playing in unison Netty Netty (also performed at the 1st Festival but now with individual ramajay performances) and followed by Lennox Jordan's arrangement of Calling Meh. &nbsp;</span></p><p><img src="../_Media/application-19_med.png" class="not-first-item" style="width:720px; height:164px;" height="164" width="720"><br><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>Mass band performance</em></span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">Inclement weather then prevented some of the planned workshops from taking place, nonetheless the event and spirit of all participants shone brightly throughout, with pan taking centre stage in the hearts and minds of all who attended. It was another successful and highly enjoyable experience. &nbsp;Certainly our band, Perth Pandemix enjoyed the event in Brisbane immensely and were happy to participate as one of the newcomers, who were made to feel at home far away from Perth.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 14px; font-family: 'Comic Sans MS';">The 3rd Australian Steelpan Festival is already in the thought process. &nbsp;Special thanks and congrats to Event Coordinator and Secretary of PANZ, Linda Fullerton, the organising committee, and all who made the event a most memorable experience. Trinidad and Tobago, after hosting the recent International Conference and Panorama, has to take note of developments in this region.</span></p><p><img src="../_Media/application-21_med.png" class="not-first-item narrow left graphic-container" style="width:400px; height:400px;" height="400" width="400"><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><br></em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><br></em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em><br></em></span></p><p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><em>Rivercity’s arranger Alvin Rostant and leader/Festival Coordinator, Linda Fullerton receiving their 1st prize.
